# Contributing to Levelheaded

We're really exited that you're about to contribute to the [Levelheaded app](https://github.com/squirrelnest/levelheaded). If this is your first time contributing, please continue reading to learn how to make the most meaningful and useful impact possible.

## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution

If you notice a problem with the app that you believe needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of
the content and/or screenshots if applicable. Owners regularly review issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement

If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

* Fork this curriculum repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in the standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo

A curriculum owner will review your change and approve or comment on it in due course.
